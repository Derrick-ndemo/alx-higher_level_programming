**Read or watch:**
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/M-MFweENpRdEfRto_Gzlvg) *Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))*
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/_Awd8Gn4SBdq2FRd_bY8KA) *(Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)*

## Tasks
### 0. Simple rectangle
- `0-rectangle.py` - an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
- `1-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `0-rectangle.py`).
### 2. Area and Perimeter
- `2-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `1-rectangle.py`).
### 3. String representation
- `3-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `2-rectangle.py`).
### 4. Eval is magic
- `4-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `3-rectangle.py`).
### 5. Detect instance deletion
- `5-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `4-rectangle.py`).
### 6. How many instances
- `6-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `5-rectangle.py`)
### 7. Change representation
- `7-rectangle.py` - a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `6-rectangle.py`).
